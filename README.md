# explanation

Please just save up and buy a proper protection tool instead of letting random people handle obfuscation. <br>
And.. maybe don't throw stones from a glass house :sob:

To everyone else, don't cheap out on protection, might take longer to save up for it but it is worth it. <br>
No disrespect to the other developers of remnant, we love y'all :hearts: <br>
Also no hate to polymorphism itself, it's not exactly good but I don't have anything against them personally.

P.S. from dyrk (dev)
this was always a fucking failed project ever since we ported everything to 1.21.4. i told pathos that it would be better to just start over since most stuff just broke (including the rotations). only decent thing here is the render engine (courtosy of moof). why was i doing the auth anyway, im literally "the menu dev"? (dont check the menu code lollll)
anyway dont use this for anything, not for skidding, not for casual usage this client sucks balls please just use ANYTHING else.
